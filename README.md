# AtmosphereLoveNumbers
This repository contains the code that was created to figure out the effect of a planet's atmosphere, and the potential loss of said atmosphere, on the planet's tidal Love number $k_2$, and the resulting migration rate.

The calculation of Love numbers was done using the ![ALMA3](https://github.com/danielemelini/ALMA3) package.

To use the code in this repository, first do
```cd ALMA3/src```
```make```
to build ALMA3.
